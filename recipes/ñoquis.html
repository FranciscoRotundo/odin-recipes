        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>

    </ul>

    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add sausages and cook until browned and firm, about 10 minutes. Cut sausages into 1/2 inch slices, return to the skillet, and continue cooking until no longer pink. Drain sausage slices on a paper towel lined plate.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in onion and cook until the onion softens and turns translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and 1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning; cook until the garlic softens, about 2 minutes. Pour in crushed tomatoes, water, salt, sugar, and remaining 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add gnocchi and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until pasta floats; drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, stir Italian sausage slices into sauce to rewarm. Toss pasta with sauce, and sprinkle with chopped parsley and grated Romano cheese to serve.</li>
