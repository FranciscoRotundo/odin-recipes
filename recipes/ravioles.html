    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Indulge in the rich, decadent bliss of homemade Four Cheese Ravioli. This recipe guides you through creating delicate pasta pockets filled with a luxurious, creamy blend of ricotta, parmesan, mozzarella, and provolone cheeses.
    Each tender ravioli is a burst of gooey, savory perfection. Traditionally served with a simple drizzle of melted butter and fresh sage or a light tomato sauce, this dish is all about celebrating the sublime, authentic flavors of Italian cheese. It's a truly special meal that turns dinner into a celebration.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>For the dough: All-purpose flour, salt, eggs, water, and olive oil.</li>
        <li>For the filling: Ricotta, Parmesan, mozzarella and provolone cheeses, an egg, and dried parsley.</li>
        <li>For the sauce: Olive oil, garlic, prepared basil pesto sauce (you can use store-bought or homemade sauce), heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, and marinara sauce.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough: Make and knead the dough, then form it into a ball. Tightly wrap the ball and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the filling: Mix the filling ingredients together and set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Cook the garlic and pesto in oil, stir in the heavy cream, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, then whisk in the Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Assemble the ravioli: Roll out the dough into sheets. Drop cheese filling onto the dough about an inch apart. Cover with the top sheet of pasta and make a seal around each portion of filling. Cut out individual ravioli, then seal the edges.</li>
        <li>Cook and bake the ravioli: Boil the ravioli in salted water until the dumplings rise to the top and the filling is hot. Drain well.</li>
        <li>Serve the ravioli: Divide the ravioli between bowls, top with the warmed marinara sauce, then finish with the sauce.</li>
    </ol>
